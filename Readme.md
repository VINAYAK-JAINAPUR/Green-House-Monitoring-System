# Greenhouse Monitoring System

## Introduction
The Greenhouse Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution designed to provide real-time monitoring and management of environmental factors crucial for optimal plant growth in greenhouses. The system integrates sensors for temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, light intensity, and cooling, sending data to a central platform accessible remotely via the Blynk app.

## Motivation
This project addresses the need to enhance efficiency and productivity in greenhouse management by leveraging IoT technology, overcoming the limitations of traditional manual systems.

## Objectives
- Develop an IoT-based system for continuous environmental monitoring.
- Implement automated controls to regulate conditions such as irrigation, cooling, and lighting.
- Optimize resource use and improve efficiency in greenhouse management.
